Illini Union Bookstore is a room. "[if unvisited]You open the door and slip inside from the cramped foyer. The faint yet sharp fragrance of espresso, presumably from the Starbucks on the east wall, is immediately evident. However, when you swing your wandering eyes to the right in order to trace the source of the scent, you see that the stand has been almost completely demolished. Bizarre claw marks stretch across the surfaces of table tops flung from their legs while the front counter and signage sit in pieces on the floor, torn apart by the same... creature. You quickly notice that this isn't the only thing out of the ordinary about the bookstore today.[end if]
This place is usually filled with students, but it is entirely empty save for an older woman combing through the merchandise toward the west wall. She doesn't look too threatening.
Whatever remains of the Starbucks lies to the EAST. Amazon@Illinois can be found at the wall to the WEST. You can head either UP or DOWN the open stairwell to the Second Floor and Basement respectively. You could also go back OUT to the Entrance to the Illini Union Bookstore."
   
Second Floor is up from Illini Union Bookstore. "Sure enough, this part of the building is devoid of life, too. Many of the larger, hardcover books, normally found neatly lined along the shelves, are strewn about the floor. A few are missing pages if the haphazard tears and scrap paper are any indication.
There's not much else to see here, though. You can go back DOWN to the main floor."
   
Basement is down from Illini Union Bookstore. "Small spatters of what look like blood, as well as even more claw marks, adorn the staircase winding down into the basement. It might not necessarily be dangerous to explore further, but it seems the basement lights have all been shut off, and the darkness is unnaturally intense despite the light of the first floor reaching the stairs.
Without a light, you can only head back UP for now."
   
Ruins of Starbucks is east from the Illini Union Bookstore. "[if unvisited]You take a moment to remember the many cups of coffee and tea enjoyed here. What a waste.[end if] 
Judging by the scale of the destruction, someone or something was clearly very angry with their messed-up order. Most of the tables and chairs as well as much of the counter are destroyed, but maybe there's something worth checking out here. You can also spot some ants crawling through the place.
You can only turn back WEST to the main floor."
   
Amazon@Illinois is west from the Illini Union Bookstore. "The wall is covered almost entirely by lockers for people to retrieve their packages. It looks straightforward enough.
You can go EAST to the main floor."

Instead of going nowhere when the player is in Basement: 
say "For some strange reason, it's just too dark to see anything past the foot of the stairs. You should walk back UP and find something to light the way."

With your curiosity peaked, you test the handle, and to your surprise the door is unlocked.
